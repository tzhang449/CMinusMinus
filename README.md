# CMinusMinus
CMinusMinus is a compiler project which makes a compiler to parse a simple C-style language into MIPS machine code. This project is to learn the basic concepts of a compiler. The formal CFG of the languange can be seen in the __*files*__ folder.

This project is in progess.

## [lab 1]
- A lexical analyser is made for the C Minus language using Flex.  
- A parser is generated to parse the C Minus text into an abstract syntax tree using Bison.

To generate the parser, run
```
cd lab1/Code && make
```
To parse a CMinusMinus text, run
```
./parser code.cmm
```
